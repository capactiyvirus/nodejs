## What are Restful API's/ Restful Services
  - Systems can used a client/server arch, Client is FE, Server is BE to save data. 
  - this uses HTTP protocol
  - Client can directly enteract with server via http and this is where REST comes into play.
  
REST - Representational State Transfer
  - We use simple http protocols to create, read, update and delete data (CRUD Operations)
  - ![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46537188/120080626-bde88580-c06e-11eb-9761-dbfd232d1bb0.png)
  - this is an example of a company with a url(endpoint)

first part is the protocol, domain, can include api but it would be the directory what we would be using (the resource)

Standarad Http methods used to interact with server ----> 
  - GET (getting data)
  - POST (creating data)
  - PUT (updating data)
  - DELETE (deleting data)
 
So as an example of a GET request ... ![Get Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46537188/120080764-3f401800-c06f-11eb-9d9e-d74a7d5c3142.png)
